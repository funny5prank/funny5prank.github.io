As he has had the disease for years and has regressed into childhood, he remembers practically nothing from his adult life. His music, friends, all his past including the memory of his daughter are a blur in his fragile mind. All he has left is the imagination of a ten year old boy. As he drifts away into coma, it seems impossible to get back what he has lost. Or is it? The film is a journey between two different dimensions. Tom travels through his imaginary world seeking answers and finding memories, while his daughter, Gem, tries to recover the bond she had once shared with her father in the real world. As they have become more and more distant from each other over the years, and as there's even greater obstacles separating them now Tom's coma and his imminent death Gem's project feels doomed to failure. However, through Tom's darkest secrets, Gem discovers the path she must follow in order to find her father again. There are some questions we must ask ourselves before entering the world of Imaginaerum. What is most important in life? Can the power of memories protect us during our last moments? Will our imagination help us find the spark of life in the deepest darkness? Can we still find love after bitter forgiveness? Imaginaerum is an emotional fantasy-adventure powered by the music of Nightwish. The story reminds us of our childhood where the smallest but most precious thing meant everything and losing it would have left an everlasting scar. Now its time to reopen the wound and see what became of it, but above all, where it came from.",

It's here that The Little Girl's magical and emotional journey into her own imagination - and into the universe of The Little Prince - begins. And it's where The Little Girl rediscovers her childhood and learns that ultimately, it's human connections that matter most, and that what's truly essential can only be seen with the heart.",

Wielding their king's magic, Nyx Ulric and his fellow glaives stand before the crown city of Insomnia, fighting to stay the inexorable advance of Niflheim's imperial army.

As the war of wills rages, the machinations of Niflheim transform Insomnia into an awe-inspiring battleground, pulling Nyx into a struggle for the very survival of the kingdom.",

While a second prayer simultaneously comes from Billy Taylor, a hopelessly romantic artist who asks that his wife receive the strength and wisdom to hold on. From these humble pleas, comes an answer in the form of a little miracle (an 8 year old runaway from heaven) who takes it upon herself to rekindle the once intimate friendship and romance that has slowly, but surely slipped away from Billy and Maire due to a heart-wrenching loss. Using all of her skill and charm (as well as some well-intentioned mischief!) our little 8 year old runaway comically sets out to heal their broken hearts and save their marriage by helping them get back to the basics of love.",

Ellen and her maternal grandmother Ruth have always had a special bond, they going on unusual adventures together, something that Ellen's more conservative mother, Cynthia, has never understood. The last words Ruth said to Ellen before she passed away was for Ellen to hand deliver a letter for her, it addressed to a Chet Cumberfield in Beacon, Maine, where, as Ellen just learns, Ruth was born and grew up, Chet of who Ellen and Cynthia had never heard. Ellen has no hesitation in obliging her grandmother's last request, it a task which she believes will take two days at the most, her return to New York when she will give Hayden an answer. Ellen makes a literal and figurative big splash upon her arrival in Beacon, that event which will forever tie her to a local contractor named Roy in the minds of Beacon residents. Physical evidence of that tie to Roy is something that Ellen wants to erase or hide, especially from Hayden. Ellen's stay in Beacon is extended as she not only has trouble trying to locate the address in question, but she begins to discover more and more information about her grandmother's past about which she previously had no idea. During Ellen's stay in Beacon, she is guided by the spirit of Ruth, who had a reason beyond delivering the message to Chet for Ellen to go on this journey, all in the name of ",
